- 🔭 I'm a student studying in South Korea. :wink:
- 🌱 I'm currently learning python and data analysis.
- 🤔 I'm interested in TypeScript and NestJS.

## About Me ✨
I am a student who is very interested in programming. Although it wasn't my major, I started to feel a sense of achievement in creating something through programming classes, and this process led me to take a serious interest in it. I plan to document my growth process while working on various toy projects.
